I am running a code in Databricks that outputs data to csv that I save in a blob storage. Then a Splunk Universal Forwarder that I have installed in a Linux VM in Azure monitors the blob storage via blobfuse to upload that data to Splunk. Do you think this is a good solution? Would you change something?

Using Databricks to output data to CSV in blob storage, then using a combination of blobfuse and Splunk Universal Forwarder on a VM for Splunk ingestion, is a valid solution. However, as with all architectural choices, there are trade-offs to consider.

Here's a review of the solution and some potential improvements or alternatives:

### Review of the Current Solution:

1. **Databricks Output to Blob Storage**: Databricks has native support for Azure Blob Storage, making it an excellent choice for outputting data. Using CSV is standard and is supported by many tools.
    
2. **Blobfuse**: Blobfuse allows you to access blob storage as if it were a local filesystem, which makes it easier to use with tools like the Splunk Universal Forwarder. It's a good bridge solution.
    
3. **Splunk Universal Forwarder**: It's a lightweight agent for Windows, Linux, and macOS that collects and sends data to a main Splunk instance. Using it on a VM to forward data is a typical setup.
    

### Potential Concerns or Areas for Improvement:

1. **Complexity and Points of Failure**: The chain (Databricks → Blob Storage → Blobfuse on VM → Splunk Universal Forwarder → Splunk) introduces several potential points of failure. Each hop introduces a bit more complexity and a potential point where things can go wrong.
    
2. **Latency**: With multiple hops, there might be some latency from when data is generated in Databricks to when it appears in Splunk.
    
3. **Cost**: Running a VM constantly in Azure isn't free. If you're monitoring the blob storage 24/7, even when no new logs are generated, you're incurring unnecessary costs.
    
4. **Scalability**: The VM-based solution with blobfuse might not scale well if the volume of data grows significantly.
    

### Possible Improvements or Alternatives:

1. **Azure Functions**: Instead of using a VM, consider using Azure Functions to trigger when new data lands in blob storage, then forward that data to Splunk. This can reduce cost and complexity.
    
2. **Native Splunk Integrations**: Splunk has various add-ons and integrations. Consider using something like the [Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/). This might reduce the need for the VM and blobfuse.
    
3. **Direct Integration**: If Splunk supports direct integration with Databricks, consider bypassing blob storage entirely and sending logs/data directly to Splunk.
    
4. **Blob Storage Retention Policies**: If you keep using blob storage, ensure you have retention policies in place to avoid incurring storage costs for old data that's no longer needed.
    
5. **Alternative Formats**: Depending on the nature and volume of your data, you might consider more compressed or efficient formats than CSV, like Parquet, which also works well with Databricks and Azure Blob Storage.
    

In conclusion, while your current solution works and is valid, there are always opportunities to refine and optimize based on cost, performance, and simplicity. You should consider future scalability, the total cost of ownership (including both monetary costs and management overhead), and the reliability of your setup when deciding on improvements or changes.
