##### Working with prebuilt images
Use [[[Docker Hub Container Image Library | Docker hub]] to find images.
Just initialize a container with the image you want. E.g:
```docker
docker run -it node
```


##### Working with custom images
For that you create a [[DockerFile]] that implements and customize an image
