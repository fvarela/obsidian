It is an optimization technique that moves filtering operations closer to the data source to reduce the amount of data that needs to be loaded and processed.

Predicate pushdown is an optimization in Spark that aims to enhance the performance of your Spark SQL queries by pushing down the filtering predicates (conditions in WHERE clauses) as close to the data source as possible. Doing so reduces the amount of data loaded into memory and processed by Spark, which improves performance and resource utilization. By applying filtering conditions at the source, you also minimize data transfer across the network, which reduces I/O overhead and leads to more efficient CPU utilization since less data needs to be processed in-memory. Additionally, predicate pushdown can help with storage optimization by only fetching the necessary data, thereby reducing memory and disk space requirements
